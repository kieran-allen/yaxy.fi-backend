1. controllers: This directory contains your app's main controllers. Controllers handle the processing of incoming requests and manage responses.

2. middlewares: This directory contains middleware functions that can be used to process requests before they reach the controllers. Middleware can include functions for authentication, validation, error handling, and more.

3. models: This directory contains the data models for your application, which define the structure of your data and any business logic related to the data. If you're using an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) like Sequelize or TypeORM, you'll define your models here.

4. routes: This directory contains your app's route definitions. Route files map HTTP requests to the appropriate controller functions.

5. services: This directory contains the services that handle business logic and interact with the data models. Services help to keep your controllers clean and decouple business logic from the requestresponse handling.

5. utils: This directory contains utility functions and helpers that can be used throughout your application.

7. app.ts: This file is the main application file that sets up the Express app, middleware, and routes. It also defines the app's configuration, such as the listening port.

8. index.ts: This file is the entry point for your application, where the Express app is started.
